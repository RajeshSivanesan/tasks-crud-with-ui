Tasks CRUD UI (FE, BE) with database support

Tomorrows TODO
1. Implement simple FE and ensure we consume all apis
and work as expected
  -- User registration
  -- User login
  -- User logout
  -- Tasks Display (pagination)
  -- Tasks deletion
  -- Tasks updation
  -- Task creation
  -- Have necessary routes
Use material-ui components
2. We can modularize even more on the backend side
create controllers folder
have it going through several layers for maintainability
in the long run
-- Should be done until this tomorrow and start test cases
3. Test cases for server / client (expectation - 70%)
